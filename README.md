# NoobNeo2 for Mac
Very basic implementation of the NoobNeo2 Layout https://github.com/xlaech/NoobNeo2 for mac.

## Basic Idea
- There is an amazing keyboard layout called Neo2 that is optimized for the german language as well as programming https://www.neo-layout.org/
- After using the layout for 2 years in work situations i came to the conclusion, that the programming and control layers 3 and 4 are a huge improvement of work quality and speed
- But Layers 1 and 2 are a big problem, because even if you acctually type slightly faster no one is able to type on your computer without you changing the keyboard

## What is NoobNeo2
- A keyboard layout
- Layer 1 and 2 are the same as on your laptop e.g. QWERTY
- It adds the layers 3 and 4 from Neo2

## Install Mac version
- Get Karabiner Elements https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/
- Download the json file into ~/.config/karabiner/assets/complex_modifications
- In the menu of Karabiner-Elements "Complex Modifications" add "Layer 3" and "Layer 4"
